## `nfctl demo`

The [NetFoundry CLI](/guides/cli) `nfctl` is an example of an application using the `netfoundry` Python module. The CLI has a built-in demo you can [run and read here](https://github.com/netfoundry/python-netfoundry/blob/main/netfoundry/ctl.py).

```bash
# or find the installed source file for demo.py under FILE heading of the built-in doc
nfctl demo
```

There's [a separate article here](./guide-demo.md) dedicated to this demo.
